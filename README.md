  AKA "Who's In?" team

"Who's In?" vision:

This software is designed for Bars, clubs, Restaurants, etc...
for the use of every person who goes out to those places.

The "Who's In?" is a social app for Android based smartphones that allows everyone to see who is inside of the establishment,
people that checked in using "Who's In?". plus users can use our web site and app to follow their friends.

Unlike any other social app available today you can see on the spot who is in without picking up your phone. 
Our project will help to satisfy peoples curiosity, it will be exclusive as we work with specific establishments, 
and give people the chance to show their picture on a TV screen. 

Project license: this project isn't open source at the moment.
